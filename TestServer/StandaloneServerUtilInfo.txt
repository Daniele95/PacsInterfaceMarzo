Dcm4che is a library containing many test utilities. Here we use the 'dcmqrscp' utility,
a simple standalone DICOM server.
This server contains 4 series, each one containing just one or a few images.
To run the server simply execute 'server.bat'. It will start serving the local port 11118.

To run the server with enabled TLS (transmission secure layer) cryptography execute 'serverTls.bat'.


The 'DICOM' folder contains the database and is indexed by the 'dicomDatabase' file.

The 'ae.properties' lists the Dicom AE (application entities) known from the server
plus their local port. The server will use this info in case it needs to issue a Dicom C-Move command.

The 'rama.jks' and 'trust.jks' are archives of keys needed for the TLS authentication. 
The same files need to be placed in the client machine (in the right archive format).
